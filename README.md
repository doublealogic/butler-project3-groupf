# Mushroom Toxicity
### Team: Aaron Robertson, Beverly Thompson and Essi Monneus

## Background

## Project Tasks
In this project, we were tasked with demystifying ML (Machine Learning). First we needed to find a problem that was worth solving, analyzing or visualizing; in our case, mushroom toxicity. We would need to use a machine learning library such as Scikit-Learn. To add to this, we would need to use at least two other tools. Below is a list of the tools we utilized:  
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
* Python Seaborn
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript Plotly
* JavaScript D3.js
* Jupyter Notebook

Finally, we would need to host our application using Heroku or a tool of our choice. We chose right here on Github using Github Pages. 

## Our Proposal/Presentation
You can find our proposal based on the above background [here](Proposal.md).

We also have a slideshow that highlights what we did along with our findings, difficulties encountered, and how we would work to enhance this project in the future.
