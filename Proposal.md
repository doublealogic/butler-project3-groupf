Butler Project 3 Final Proposal
Group F: Aaron Robertson, Beverly Thompson, Essi Monneus
Proposal Chosen: #18 – Mushroom Toxicity
The final product will be a website dedicated to Mushroom Toxicity in terms of eating healthy and learning about both safe and not-safe mushrooms. We would use Bootstrap for the menus and user interface.
Throughout our process we will be using an Agile to tool to help us manage our workflow.
Visual Display of Mushrooms
* We would use several charts about the mushrooms using Pandas and Matplotlib to display the relationship between the mushrooms.
* These graphs would help answer what qualities make mushrooms safe to eat. (Color, Odor, Cap Shape, Rings, Habitat, etc….)
Mushroom Toxicity Predictor
* What is this mushroom? Can I eat it?
* This predictor would help answer both the above questions. We would use machine learning to take an image of a mushroom, predict which fungi it is and based on that prediction if it’s toxic or not.
