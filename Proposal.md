Butler Project 3 Final Proposal

Group F: Aaron Robertson, Beverly Thompson, Essi Monneus

Proposal Chosen: #18 â€“ Mushroom Toxicity

The final product will be a website dedicated to Mushroom Toxicity in terms of eating healthy and learning about both safe and not-safe mushrooms. We would use Bootstrap for the menus and user interface.

Throughout our process we will be using an Agile to tool to help us manage our workflow.
